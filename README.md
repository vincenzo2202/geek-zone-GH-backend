## Objetive
The goal of this project has been to address a need that arises in most online teaching modalities. Due to the lack of physical spaces, students often don't have areas to interact with each other. That's why GEEK ZONE was created as a virtual campus tool where students and teachers can connect and share code.
  
## About the project
I have decided to develop a backend system to support the Geek Zone app. This system will allow both students and teachers to register and start sharing content among themselves.

Additionally, the system will facilitate communication by enabling user tracking, fostering richer connections among users.

The system will also incorporate the creation of events by instructors, where students can confirm their attendance.

## Diagrama DB 

In the diagram, we can observe that each user can have only one role, including 'user' for students, 'admin' for teachers, and 'superadmin' for those who acquire the role of managing the application, possibly the academy manager.

On the other hand, each user will be able to create posts, like and comment on posts, follow classmates and teachers, view events, and communicate participation in said event. The application also features a chat in the development phase.

I also want to express my gratitude to my colleagues, especially to Andr√©s Labat and Bienvenida Ladr√≥n, for the many hours of joint study; And finally, to my wife, for the support she has provided me throughout this training. Without her unwavering assistance, this would not have been possible.
